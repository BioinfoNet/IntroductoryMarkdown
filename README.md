# Introductory Markdown

This is a short introduction to Markdown, a pre-requisite to GitHub and Literate programming tools (Jupyter, R Notebooks). 

## Introduction

Markdown a plain text formatting syntax; and a software tool that converts the plain text formatting to HTML. Any text editor can be used to prepare markdown documents but needs a markdown software to convert it. Markdown editors, however, have an inbuilt conversion tool. Rstudio can convert markdown to a variety of formats, including HTML, pdf. 

For the purpose of this training, we will use the [online editor](https://markdown-here.com/livedemo.html) for editing and rendering. 

## Markdown Syntax

We will use the [Markdown Here Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) materials to learn the basic syntax. See also: https://commonmark.org/help/.
